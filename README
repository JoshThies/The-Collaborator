Virtual Human Connection - “Explore the dynamics of human connection in the age of technology. Depict the intersection between 
virtual and physical connections, highlighting the challenges and opportunities.”

Our device turns the process of making music into a collaborative experience at a crossroads where people of different levels of 
proficiency in music can engage with each other. It broadens learning opportunities for those less knowledgeable in music 
production while creating new challenges for those who are more proficient by engaging with their capacity to think and act 
beyond their own capabilities. We hope to see music born out of a shared experience that embodies community and is represents 
of the integrated creativity and personality of different kinds of people, rather than just the output of a single individual.
